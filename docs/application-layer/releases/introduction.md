# Releases

The Releases section provides an overview of recent changes made to the API's and models, along with a list of currently deployed versions. This documentation will guide you through understanding the draft banner, accessing deployed versions, and deploying new versions.

## Understanding Draft Banner

When changes are made to the API's or models, a draft banner will be displayed to indicate that new updates are available. The banner will include a brief description and provide a call to action to review and deploy these changes.
