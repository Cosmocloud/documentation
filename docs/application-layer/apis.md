# APIs
REST APIs are the essence of Backend Development, the most used way for your frontend (client) to talk to your backend layer. There are various ways to create APIs in your Cosmocloud project.

## Using Templates
You can quickly start creating the APIs and their corresponding models using use-case based Templates. These help you in auto generating convention based APIs and models for faster productivity.

You can then customise and edit any API or model that is created via Templates.

### Available Templates
- CRUD APIs
- Search APIs (coming soon)
- Media / Object upload (coming soon)

## Building from Scratch
This is the method where you can start building your APIs from scratch. This will help you in customising your API endpoints, request methods as well as any[ Query Param Models](/application-layer/models#query-params) / [Request Body Models](/application-layer/models#request-body) you want to use.
