# Model Types

Models defines the various schema definitions in your project, where you would need to define the structure of the data. There are 3 types of Models in Cosmocloud right now -

### Database Collection Models
These define and mirror the database collections (tables / entities) in the system. The name of these models should be exactly the same as the underlying Database collection.

    You can check the `Database Collection` model naming convention [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-Restriction-on-Collection-Names). You can easily define these as strings containing [a-zA-Z0-9_] characters and ***cannot*** begin with numbers or underscore.
