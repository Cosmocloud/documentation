# Flow-Engine

Flow-engine is way through which users can design API workflows that fits their specific requirements for that API. Flow-engine offers a range of nodes that can be utilized to create and maintain the flow of the APIs. These nodes act as building blocks, allowing users to customize and control the behaviour of the API flow.

## Key Features

1. **Visual Representation**: The flow engine provides an intuitive visual interface that enables users to create and manage API workflows using different types of nodes based on required functionality.

2. **Node Variety**: Users have access to a diverse set of nodes, each serving a specific purpose within the API workflow such as `HTTP Request`, `HTTP Response` nodes.

3. **Customizable Logic**: Nodes like `Fetch Record`, `Fetch Multiple Records`, `Build JSON Object` etc. allow users to introduce custom logic and transformations.

4. **Data Manipulation**: Users can fetch records, manipulate data, and build complex responses using the provided nodes.

5. **Flexibility**: The platform accommodates a wide range of API flow scenarios, from simple interactions to more intricate processes.

6. **Efficiency**: Users can design and modify API flows in an efficient manner, reducing development time.
