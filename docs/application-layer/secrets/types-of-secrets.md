# Types of Secrets

## Authentication secret

`Authentication secret` is a confidential piece of information used to verify the identity of users or applications during the authentication process. It is a fundamental component of secure access control and user authentication. Authentication secrets are used to ensure that only authorized users or applications are granted access to protected resources.

## Database secret

`Database secret` is a confidential credential used to establish secure connections and access databases. It includes authentication information that allows your application to authenticate itself to a database management system (i.e. MongoDB). Database secrets typically include credentials such as `Database name`, `Mode`, `ProjectId`, `PublicKey`, `PrivateKey`, `ClusterName` or `MongoURI`.

## Custom secret

A `Custom secret` is a confidential piece of information that you can store in your project which can be used for specific purposes within the application. Custom secret can be an API key, encryption keys, tokens, AWS credentials or any other authentication or authorization credentials.
