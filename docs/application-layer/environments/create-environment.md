# Creating Environments

**Environments** allows you to organize your work and collaborate efficiently. You start with a default `Production` environment, and you can create more environments to suit your needs! Let's see what each environment offers:

# How to Create an Environment

1. Click on the `Create Environment` button in the Environments section.
2. Choose the type of environment you want to create: `Staging`, `Development`, or `Custom`.
3. If you select `Custom,` you can give it a unique name and set its sharing options.
4. For `Production` and `Staging,` the resources are automatically set to `Dedicated` for optimal performance.
5. For `Development` and `Custom,` you can specify whether you want dedicated resources or sharing with other environments.
