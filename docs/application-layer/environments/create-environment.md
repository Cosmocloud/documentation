# Creating Environments

**Environments** allows you to organize your work and collaborate efficiently. You start with a default `Production` environment, and you can create more environments as per your needs.

# How to Create an Environment

1. Click on the `Create Environment` button in the **Environments List** section.
2. Choose the type of environment you want to create: `Staging`, `Development` or `Custom`.
3. If you have selected `Custom` environment type, you are required to give it a unique name.
4. For environment types other than `Custom`, the name of environment will be set automatically.
5. For `Production` and `Staging` environment type, the resources are automatically set to `Dedicated` for optimal performance.
6. For `Development` and `Custom` environment type, you may specify whether you want dedicated resources or shared resources.
7. If you have selected **dedicated resources**,then you have to select a tier, that will ensure the amount of resources to be allocated to that environment.
8. If you have selected **shared resources**, then you need to select an environment with which the resources will be shared.

 
!!! info "Info"

    - `Production`,`Staging` and `Development` environments can only be created once. For creating multiple environments select `Custom` environment instead.
    - Sharing of resources is only possible in environments with dedicated resources.
