# Introduction

**Environments** feature allows users to create and manage multiple infra environments for their projects, so that you can have multiple layers of testing or different versions deployed on different environments.

### What is an Environment?

An environment is a self-contained individually scaled space where users can deploy and test their applications independent of each other. This feature is especially useful for managing development, staging, production and custom environments.

### Available Environments Types

- Production (default)
