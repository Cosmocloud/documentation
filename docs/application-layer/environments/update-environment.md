# Updating Environments

With our `Environments` feature, changing configurations can be done with just a few clicks. Here's a step-by-step guide to updating your environments:

### Navigate to the Environment Listing Page

- From the main dashboard, click on the `Environments` section. You'll see a list of all your environments, including `Production,` `Staging,` `Development,` and any custom environments that you have created.

### Select the Environment to Update

- Find the environment you want to update in the list and click on it. This will redirect you to the `Environment Details` page specific to that environment.

### Explore the Editable Sections

- On the `Environment Details` page, you will see various sections relevant to the selected environment. Some sections will be editable, while others are read-only.

### Make Your Changes

Depending on the environment type, you'll have different editable options. For example:

- In the `Production` and `Staging` environments, you can adjust tier settings but cannot adjust resource allocations.
- In the `Development` and `Custom` environments, you can adjust tier settings and sharing preferences.

### Click on Save

- Once you've made the desired changes, click on the `Save` button at the top-right of the page.
- You will see an acknowledgement message once the changes have been saved.
- The environment is now updated with the new settings.
