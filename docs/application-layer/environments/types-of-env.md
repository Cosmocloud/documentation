# Types of Environments

### Production Environment

This is the default environment for your project where your final and polished app should reside. A `Production` environment can only have its own dedicated resources and cannot be shared with any other environment to maintain the highest level of performance,security and reliability.

### Staging Environment

This environment is to test your application before sending the application to production. Just like the `Production` environment, it also has dedicated resources by default and are not shareable with others, ensuring privacy during testing and development.

### Development Environment

The `Development` environment is the stage for experimenting and trying out new features. You can have either dedicated resources or share it with any other dedicated environemnt.

### Custom Environments

The `Custom` environment is versatile and fully customizable to the liking of user. Unlike the other environments, you can create as many `Custom` environments as you want. You also have the option to share the resources of this environment with other dedicated environments or keep it dedicated, depending on your specific needs.
