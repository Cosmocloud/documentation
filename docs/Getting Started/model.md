# Create your first Model

Now that we have our database set up, we can create our first model. To do this, we need to go to the [models page](https://dashboard.cosmocloud.io/models) and click on the "Model" tab in the sidebar. This will take us to the models page.

Here we'll need to fill in the form. We'll need to give our model a name and some optional description. Then we'll need to select the model type, for example request body or database collection.

Once we've done this, we'll need to click the "Create" button. This will create the model and redirect us to the model page.

In the model page, we define the schema for our model. We can do so by adding individual fields by clicking + icon next to every field box. We create a field by entering field name, defining their types, categorizing as required or not.

In the above example, we have defined some fields for our model "Product" which we shall be using to create our first API.
After we have defined the schema, we can click on the "Save" button. This will save the model and redirect us to the models page.
