# Creating your first project

## Organisation setup

When you log in for the first time, you'll be asked to create an organisation. An organisation is the home for all your projects, including permission management as well as billing and payments.

> An organisation needs to have a unique name across the system. You would only be allowed to create an organisation if the name is not in use by any other Cosmocloud user.

## Creating projects

A single project is like a single Microservice, which can independently be deployed, scaled and managed.

To create a project, you'll need to provide the following -

- A unique name within your Organisation. (You can also update this later)
- Your preferred Cloud Provider.
- Your preferred region in the chosen Cloud Provider.

> You might want to chose the same Cloud Provider / region, which you might already be using with your existing services, and/or where your users / data is residing. This will help lower the network latency and increase performance.

Once created, the underlying infrastructure and resources are already spinned up for you in the background, you don't have to worry about anything else!
