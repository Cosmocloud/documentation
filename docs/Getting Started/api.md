# Create your first API

Now that we have our database and model setup we can create our first API! To do this, we need to go to the [APIs page](https://dashboard.cosmocloud.io/apis) or click on the "API" tab under application layer in the sidebar. This will take us to the APIs page.

Here we can create our first API. To do this, we need to click on the "New API" button. This will open a popup. In this popup, we have two options to select, either create a new API from scratch or create a new API from a template. For this tutorial, we'll be creating a new API from templates. So we'll need to select the "Browse templates" option.
Once we've done this, we'll need to select a template from the options as we can see below.

For this tutorial, we'll be selecting the "Entity CRUD APIs" template. Once we've selected the template, we'll need to click the "next" button. This will lead us to configure section. Here we'll need to select the Model we created earlier. Once we've done this, we'll need to click the "next" button. This will lead us to the review section.

Here we can review the API we're about to create. Once we've reviewed the API, we'll need to click the "Create" button. This will create the API and redirect us to the API page.

We can see all of our created APIs as draft by default. We can add more APIs or edit the existing ones. Once we're done, we can go to deployments section.
