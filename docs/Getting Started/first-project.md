# Creating First project

When you log in for the first time, you'll be asked to create an organisation. An organisation is the home for all your projects.

After you've created an organisation, you'll be asked to create a project.

To create a project, you'll need to give it a name. The name must be unique within the organisation. You can rename the project later if you wish.

After giving a name, you'll need to select a cloud provider amongst google cloud, amazon web services, and microsoft azure. You'll also need to select a cloud region. The region is where the project will be hosted. <!-- You can change the cloud provider and region later if you wish. -->
