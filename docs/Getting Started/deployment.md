# Create your first Deployment

Now that we have our APIs created and models defined, we can create our first deployment! To do this, we need to go to the [Releases page](https://dashboard.cosmocloud.io/releases) or click on the releases tab in the sidebar under the application layer. This will take us to the releases page.

Here we can create our first deployment. To do this, we need to click on the "review and deployment" button next to the draft we want to deploy. This will open a popup where we can configure and review our deployment.

In the popup as shown above we first select the entities to deploy in our deployment. We can select the APIs and Models we've already defined as drafts in the previous steps. Once we've selected the entities, we'll need to click the "next" button. This will lead us to the "Add version and description" section. Here we'll need to add a version and description for our deployment. Once we've done this we can deploy our application by clicking the "Deploy" button. This will deploy our application instantly and redirect us to the releases page.

Here we can see all of our deployments. We can add more deployments or edit the existing ones.
